Getting OpenWeatherMap's weather data using Python.

This script will show you how to get the weather's temperature from OpenWeatherMap and send a text using Twilio to yourself, 
friend, or any program that can make use of the temperature. There are different ways on how you can automate this script. The one that I chose to do it is my having a cronjob run this script every 30 minutes in an Ubuntu server.
